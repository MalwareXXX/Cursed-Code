# Odd Code Snippets in Multiple Languages

This README file contains a collection of odd or unconventional code snippets in different programming languages. These code snippets may not follow best practices or may be confusing, but they can be useful for exploring different syntaxes and programming styles. Please make sure to pull and other snippets!

## Python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [4, 5, 6]
print(x+y)

This code snippet demonstrates the + operator in Python, which can be used to concatenate two lists. The output of this code is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

## Java
int x = 5;
System.out.println(x+++x);

This code snippet demonstrates the use of the ++ operator in Java. When the ++ operator is used twice in a row, it increments the variable twice. The output of this code is 11.

## JavaScript
var a = [1, 2, 3];
a[10] = 10;
console.log(a);

This code snippet demonstrates how you can add elements to an array in JavaScript by assigning a value to an index that is larger than the array's current length. The output of this code is [1, 2, 3, empty Ã— 7, 10], where empty represents undefined values in the array.

## C
#include <stdio.h>
#define square(x) x*x
int main() {
    int i = 4;
    printf("%d\n", square(i+1));
    return 0;
}

This code snippet demonstrates the use of the #define directive in C to define a macro that replaces one piece of text with another. In this example, the macro square replaces x*x with i+1*i+1, which evaluates to 4+1*4+1 and gives us a result of 9.

## Ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, world!"
end

hello_world(true) and false or true and hello_world

This code snippet demonstrates how the and and or operators have lower precedence than && and || in Ruby. This can lead to unexpected results when combining these operators with other expressions. In this example, the and operator is used to call the hello_world method with a true argument, and then the or and and operators are used to print "Hello, world!" again. The output of this code is "Hello, world!\n".
